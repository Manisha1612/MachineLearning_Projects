# MachineLearning_Projects
Machine learning projects from beginners to advance level using Python Programming and Open Dataset

1.Python File : Iris_dataset_usingRegression_KNN_SVM_Model.ipynb

PREDICT A TYPE OF FLOWER using Regression, KNN, SVM model

DATASET : Iris Dataset

Iris dataset is a Famous dataset , every beginner can start to work with this data. 
this dataset is simple to understand , no categorical values are there only numerical values are there.
Data is clean and can apply the model easily. 
After Applying the regression technique , i got the Accuracy 98%, which is good.

2. Python File : Product_SalesPrediction_UsingAdvertisingData.ipynb
PREDICT : Predict the sales based on the Advertising media e.g TV, Radio, NewsPaper, using Regression Model

Dataset : Kaggle - Advertising Data
The sale is high when the investment is in TV Advertise. With respect to data we can see Advertising in Newspaper is not increase
the sale so it is not so effective to increase sale.

3. Python File : Heart_Diesease_Prediction_UsingClassification.ipynb
Predict : Predict wether the person will suffer from Heart Disease or Not.

Dataset : Dataset is taken from Kaggle.com , Dataset : Heart Disease UCI

Total 14 Features are there 13 out of them are contributing towards Heart Disease and  1 is the Class/Target Feature.
Here I have shown Accuracy using TWO Models : KNN and Random Forest.
Data Visualization has been done to see the corelation of the features.
