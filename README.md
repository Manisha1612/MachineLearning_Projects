# MachineLearning_Projects
Machine learning projects from beginners to advance level using Python Programming and Open Dataset

1.Python File : Iris_dataset_usingRegression_KNN_SVM_Model.ipynb

PREDICT A TYPE OF FLOWER using Regression, KNN, SVM model

DATASET : Iris Dataset

Iris dataset is a Famous dataset , every beginner can start to work with this data. 
this dataset is simple to understand , no categorical values are there only numerical values are there.
Data is clean and can apply the model easily. 
After Applying the regression technique , i got the Accuracy 98%, which is good.

2. Python File : Product_SalesPrediction_UsingAdvertisingData.ipynb
PREDICT : Predict the sales based on the Advertising media e.g TV, Radio, NewsPaper, using Regression Model

Dataset : Kaggle - Advertising Data
The sale is high when the investment is in TV Advertise. With respect to data we can see Advertising in Newspaper is not increase
